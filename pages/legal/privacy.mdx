# Privacy policy for POTATO

POTATO's servers may cache information such as messages, usernames, profile pictures, etc. This is to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

If the automoderation and/or anti-raid systems are enabled for a guild by a guild adminstrator, all messages sent in that will be logged on POTATO's servers. The logged messages are stored for a maximum of three months, and a guild administrator disabling both the automoderation and anti-raid systems will remove all the logged messages from POTATO's servers.
These messages are logged to enable the auomoderation and anti-raid system functionality, and wil not be used for anything else.
